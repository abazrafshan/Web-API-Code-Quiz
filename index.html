                <h1>Coding Quiz</h1>
                <p>
                    Take the following quiz and test your knowledge with code-related questions. You will be working to a time limit and incorrect answers will penalize your time by 15 seconds. This quiz consists of 5 questions, if you finish the quiz with time left on the clock, the remaining time will be saved as your score. No score will be saved if time limit reaches 0. Good luck!
                </p>
